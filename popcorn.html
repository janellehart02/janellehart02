  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <p>For the most buttery and delicious popcorn, follow the steps below:<br>
 <ol>
   <li>Add 1/4 cup of vegetable oil (or any high heat oil) to a deep pan, or enough to thinly layer the bottom of the pan.</li>
   <li>Add 3/4 cup of popcorn kernels, cover the pan with a lid, and turn the stove on high heat.</li>
   <li>When you hear popping begin, shake the pan side to side to prevent the kernels from sticking to the bottom and burning.</li>
   <li>Continue to shake every 20 to 30 seconds until you hear the popping slow down.</li>
   <li>Turn off the heat and pour the popcorn into a large, deep bowl.</li>
   <li>Melt 4 tbsps of salted butter in the microwave for 30 seconds and then pour over the popcorn in increments, shaking the bowl in between rounds.</li> 
     <li>Add a few pinches of salt (or whatever spices you prefer), mix, and serve.</li>
</ol>
  </p>
  <p id="sup">*A few other toppings I recommend are melted dark chocolate with flaky sea salt, olive oil with rosemary and garlic seasoning, chili lime seasoning, or chipotle seasoning. </p>
